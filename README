How It Works
Catalogue: A list of available products with code, name, and price.
Basket: Maintains products, applies special offers, calculates delivery.
Delivery Rules: Configurable rules for delivery costs.
Special Offers: Easily extendable for various promotions.

Running the Project
Build the container with Docker: docker-compose up --build.
Run tests: docker exec -it app-container vendor/bin/phpunit.

Assumptions
All products have unique codes.
Discounts apply only once per pair (e.g., "Buy 1 Get 1 Half Off").
Delivery rules are tiered with no overlaps.
